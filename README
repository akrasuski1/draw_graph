This program is used to draw mathematical graphs.
Usage:
./draw_graph.py [-d] [-h] [-o] [-s filename.jpg]
Flags:
-d
	use directed graphs (default: non-directed)
-h
	show this help
-o
	index vertices from one (default: zero-indexing)
-s filename.jpg
	 save graph image as filename.jpg

The program reads from stdin input in the following form:
First, two integers 'n' and 'm', where:
n - number of vertices,
m - number of edges.
Then, there are m descriptions of edges, each consisting
of two integers - source and destination vertex numbers.
Note that after sending input the program is still interactive
- you can for example press 'S' key to save a screenshot

Example usage:
./draw_graph.py -d <<< "5 3
1 2
1 4
4 0"
